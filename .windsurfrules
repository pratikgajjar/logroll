Goal is to build end to working app in rust which reads cdc logs from postgres, creates batch based on time or size and uploads to s3 in parquet format with zstd level 3 compression.

- Design from first principles
- Follow SOLID principles
- Divide into modular components to manage complexity
- Optimize for blazing fast performance
- Build resilience to failures
- Handle graceful shutdowns
- Frequently verify compilation with `cargo check`
- Structure code to enable graceful error handling
- Use postgres_replication for replication logic
- Configure pgoutput as the replication plugin
- Implement structured logging throughout, use info, debug, error, warn
- Compile frequently to catch errors early
- Do not update README.md unless explicitly requested
